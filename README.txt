(Bad) Hacking Idea Generator
Created for Hakron 2.0 by Glenn Booth

This page gives you a bad idea for a hackathon. Or maybe not so bad. 
You should probably not try to go along with any ideas this gives you.

Code works like this:
outline of statement
Ex: My hack is (Column1) (BadColumn2) (BadColumn3)
Ex: My hack is "an Audrino" "covered in" "cheese sauce"

Split by 3 columns. First column is the name of the device "a website" "a raspi" etc.
Second column is an action "that controls" "interfaces with" "computes" etc
Third column is what the device is acting on "a robotic arm" "a dataset" etc

Second and third columns will have alt versions for bad ideas.

Site has a database of the columns. When user goes to site, the page will output
a randomly generated statement built from the 3 columns.
